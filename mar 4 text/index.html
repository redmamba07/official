        	<p>about ridiculousness
	 		Ridiculousness and Rob Dyrdek return with another incredible season of hysterical and absurd internet videos. Sterling “Stee-Lo” Brim and Chanel “West Coast” join Rob and another unbelievable line up of special guests, including rapper phenom Future, R &amp; B singer/ songwriter Ne-Yo, and internet video super-team Smosh. This season's storm of new categories like “Power Kiss”, “Everyday Demons”, "Human Glitches”, and “Magnet Feet” will leave you belly laughing for the rest of your life.</p>
		
			<P>MTV viewers might know Dyrdek from his starring role in the reality series Rob and Big -- you know, the adoptive parent of Mini-Horse, the man who performs as alter-ego "Bobby Light" or the guy who tried to teach bulldog Meaty to skateboard. Yeah, Rob Dyrdek is that guy, but he's also a professional skateboarder who simply refuses to stop chasing glory and an entrepreneur with quite a knack for business.</P>

			<p>As an entrepreneur, he has contributed game changing shoe design concepts, developed private training facilities for pro boarders and launched companies that include Siler Trucks, Reflex Bearings and Rogue Status, a street wear line that he owns with former blink-182 drummer Travis Barker. He also has his own sunglasses company (Battle Eyewear)!</p>
